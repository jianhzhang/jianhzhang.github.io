# About Me


Here is **Jianhan Zhang (张剑寒)**.       
Currently, I am in my fifth year as a Ph.D. candidate in economics at the University of Guelph in Canada, with an expected completion date in January 2024. My research interests encompass both **econometrics theory** and **applied econometrics**.

## Working papers  
**Endogeneity Kink Threshold Regression**(R&R **JBES**) [[PDF]](https://jianhzhang.github.io/file/Endogenous_kink.pdf),

**Abstruct**: This paper considers an endogenous kink threshold regression model with an unknown threshold value in a time series as well as a panel data framework, where both the threshold variable and regressors are allowed to be endogenous. We construct our estimators from a nonparametric control function approach and derive the consistency and asymptotic distribution of our proposed estimators. Monte Carlo simulations are used to assess the finite sample performance of our proposed estimators. Finally, we apply our model to analyze the impact of COVID-19 cases on labor markets in the US and Canada.

**Threshold Regression Model with Mismeasured Variables**,    
(**Jianhan Zhang**, [Yiguo Sun](https://www.uoguelph.ca/lang/people/yiguo-sun))   
<br/> 
**Abstruct**:In this article, we consider a threshold regression model with possibly mismeasured regressors. Following [Lewbel(2012)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07350015.2012.643126), we employ error heteroskedasticity to construct valid moment conditions. This method proves especially useful when instrumental variables or other side information are missing or unreliable. We propose a two-step GMM estimator as well as a robust estimator based on the median of means method to overcome possible heavy-tailed problems. We apply our approach to investigate the potential threshold relationship among investment, Tobin's q, and cash flow.
