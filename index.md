Here is **Jianhan Zhang (张剑寒)**. I earned my PhD in Economics from the University of Guelph in 2024, under the supervision of Professors Thanasis Stengos and Yiguo Sun.  

I am currently an Assistent Professor at School of Statistics, [[DUFE](https://www.dufe.edu.cn)]. My research interests encompass both **econometrics theory** and **applied econometrics**.  
<br> 
 **Current research**: **Threshold regression/endogeneity/Spatial Model/Tobin's q theory**

## Working papers  
**Measurement Error in Threshold Regression: Robust Estimation and Inference**(submitted),    
(**Jianhan Zhang**, [Yiguo Sun](https://www.uoguelph.ca/lang/people/yiguo-sun))   
<br/> 
**Abstruct**:In this article, we study a threshold regression model in the presence of potentially mismeasured regressors. Exploiting a verifiable nonlinear relationship between the mismeasured variables and other observed covariates, we propose a novel two-step GMM estimator, along with a robust alternative based on the median-of-means gradient to address potential issues arising from heavy-tailed distributions. This approach is particularly useful when instrumental variables or other auxiliary information are unavailable or unreliable. Finally, we apply our methodology to examine the potential threshold relationship among investment, Tobin’s $q$, and cash flow.
