## Working papers  
**Threshold Regression Model with Mismeasured Variables**,    
(**Jianhan Zhang**, [Yiguo Sun](https://www.uoguelph.ca/lang/people/yiguo-sun))   
<br/> 
**Abstruct**:In this article, we consider a threshold regression model with possibly mismeasured regressors. Following [Lewbel(2012)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07350015.2012.643126), we employ error heteroskedasticity to construct valid moment conditions. This method proves especially useful when instrumental variables or other side information are missing or unreliable. We propose a two-step GMM estimator as well as a robust estimator based on the median of means method to overcome possible heavy-tailed problems. We apply our approach to investigate the potential threshold relationship among investment, Tobin's q, and cash flow.
